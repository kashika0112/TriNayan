# TriNayan
 ï»¿The main motive of TriNayan is to tackle the issues of incompatibility of the content, services, and resources that the web pages offer with the help of WEBSITE MODIFIERS so that even people with disabilities are able to use them to the fullest. For example, any website can be converted to speech, text, sign language, etc.
